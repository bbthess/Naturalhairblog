The purpose of the app is to serve as a tool to aid people considering going natural and for those who are already natural. It will provide in depth information and help facilitate the practices of caring for the hair. 

The texture of African hair makes it very difficult to care and maintain due to its coarse nature. This prevents most African textured hair people from keeping and maintaining their hair in its natural state hence resulting to relaxing it with more chemical products such as lye relaxers.
I am creating this app as a natural hair blog to help people with African textured hair in caring and maintaining their natural hair without resorting to too much chemical products. It will also showcase different natural hair styles choices for its users.
